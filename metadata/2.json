{"name":"Night Journey","description":"‘Night Journey’- a gentle summer breeze harmonizes with the faint hum of traffic below, as the last train approaches the platform. \n\nThis piece is inspired by personal photography and experiences, and based off of the Yamanote Line (山手線), a circular route that runs through central Tokyo! During the day, this is one of the busiest lines in the world, and yet during the early morning and late night, it is surprisingly calm.\n\nSAU’s train series of artworks is an exploration of the liminal qualities of Japanese trains and stations. He aims to capture the fleeting moments of joy in everyday life, in a place where transition, change and adventure is always happening. \n\nI hope that through these pieces, you will feel that brief moment vicariously too.\n\nCreated by SAU from August 28 - December 31, 2020\nProcreate\n4800x4800px\n","image":"ipfs://QmPkP1mDwKWLXp1NNrAE6Qb8kUYdxsxkC4TDw3kfiJqip4/nft.jpg"}
