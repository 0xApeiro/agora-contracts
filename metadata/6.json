{"name":"Bloom","description":"'Bloom' is the wistful yet fresh atmosphere of an spring day. The sakura trees gently rustle and the train approaches the platform.\n\nSAUâ€™s train series of artworks is an artistic exploration of the liminal qualities of Japanese trains and stations. He aims to capture the fleeting moments of joy in everyday life, in a place where transition, change and adventure is always happening.\n\nI hope that through these pieces, you will feel that brief moment vicariously too.\n\nCreated by SAU on May 1, 2019\nProcreate\n4800x4800px","image":"ipfs://QmWmat3UP5DN4RfQz33YAVRfonoMwPvJL2irpVQBLs8VaH/nft.jpg"}
