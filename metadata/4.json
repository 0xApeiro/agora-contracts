{"name":"Early Bird","description":"'Early Bird' is the blissful feeling of stepping into the warmth of the morning. A new day is ahead, along with all the possibilities it may bring. This piece is inspired by personal photography and experiences, and based off of the Chūō Line (中央線快速), a rapid train that runs through central Tokyo!\n\nSAU’s train series of artworks is an artistic exploration of the liminal qualities of Japanese trains and stations. He aims to capture the fleeting moments of joy in everyday life, in a place where transition, change and adventure is always happening. \n\nI hope that through these pieces, you will feel that brief moment vicariously too.\n\nCreated by SAU from March 1-6, 2020 \nProcreate\n4800x4800px\n","image":"ipfs://QmNa1Dzy38EfEqUA8zqCo5oMgEFRotkLRSMUmQ36ApKELt/nft.jpg"}
