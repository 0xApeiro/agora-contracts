{"name":"Summer Memory","description":"‘Summer Memory’ is the embrace of the afternoon sun after the rain, reflecting off the station platform on the way home. It’s a sudden wave of nostalgia and longing for days past. This piece is based on the beautiful, sunlit train station platforms of Kyoto, Japan! \n\nSAU’s train series of artworks is an exploration of the liminal qualities of Japanese trains and stations. He aims to capture the fleeting moments of joy in everyday life, in a place where transition, change and adventure is always happening. \n\nI hope that through these pieces, you will feel that brief moment vicariously too.\n\nCreated by SAU from May 23 - June 1, 2020 \nProcreate\n4800x4800px\n\n\n","image":"ipfs://QmcEjzf5njW8X8vHo4osHE4hA6kw7JydT4X9BDZPjMRcpb/nft.jpg"}
